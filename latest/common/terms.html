    <dt><dfn>Account Provider</dfn></dt>

    <dd>At its core, a payment is a transfer of value from one account to another.
    An account is a store of value with a balance and a history of debits and
    credits that affect that balance. The account provider is responsible for
    managing and controlling access to one or more accounts on behalf of the
    account owner (usually a payer or payee). Account owners access their accounts
    through payment instruments. The rules
    that govern usage of a payment instrument constitute a payment
    scheme. An accountâ€™s value is represented
    as a series of deposits (credits) and withdrawals (debits) and is recorded in a
    ledger maintained by the account provider.</dd>

    <dt><dfn>Account Owner</dfn></dt>

    <dd>An account owner is the entity with the legal right of ownership of any
    asset in an account provided to them by an account provider. The account owner
    may directly or indirectly transfer some or all of this asset out of the
    account or take ownership of additional assets in the account as a result of a
    completed payment and settlement process.</dd>

    <dt><dfn>Regulator</dfn></dt>
    <dd>The regulator is responsible for monitoring some
    payments activities and enforcing legal requirements. The payment flow may be
    interrupted and the payment aborted or cancelled if the regulator does not
    approve the conditions of payment.</dd>

    <dt><dfn>Settlement Service</dfn></dt>

    <dd>Settlement is the process of discharging any obligations that exist between
    parties to a payment. This process involves the final and irrevocable movement
    of value between the accounts of the payer and payee and any counterparties to
    the transaction through the capture of debits and credits in the ledgers upon
    which the accounts are recorded.

    <p>Today the provision of settlement services is reserved for centralised
    entities such as central banks or in the case of cross-border payments a
    combination of central and correspondent banks however it is technically
    feasible that settlement services could be provided by any entity in a Web
    payments architecture.</p>
