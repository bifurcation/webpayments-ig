This document is a work in progress and is being released early and often
using an agile process; it is incomplete.
    </p>
The Web Payments IG has only had the opportunity to review a handful of the
40+ use cases, 120+ requirements, and hundreds of pages of
payments research submitted to the group via various other standards group
output such as ISO20022, research documents from X9 and the US Federal Reserve,
documents from the Web Payments Community Group, and input from the
general public. Expect this document to be rapidly iterated upon.

    <h2>High Priority Use Cases</h2>
    <p>
The following use cases have been identified by the Web Payments Interest
Group as high-priority items.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Initiating a Payment</h3>
      <p>
A <tref>customer</tref> selects a product or service to purchase on a website.
The website generates a payment request that is sent to the customer's
<tref>payment agent</tref> for processing.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Basic Flow</h4>
        <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;
  max-height:100%; max-width:75%;" src="images/payment-initiation.svg">
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Penny uses the HobbyCo website to select a model train for
purchase. The store generates a payment request which is then forwarded to
her <tref>payment agent</tref>. For more information on what happens
next, see the <a href="#choosing-a-payment-instrument">
choosing a payment instrument</a> use case</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: A FarmCo <tref>customer</tref> selects a 10 kg bag of grass
seed for purchase. FarmCo performs a few database lookups to determine the
current market price of grass seed and generates a <tref>payment request</tref>
for the final amount of the selected product. The payment request
is transmitted to the customer’s <tref>payment agent</tref>.
          </li>
          <li>
Payment Processor POV (<tref>payer</tref>-initiated payment):
A PayCo <tref title="customer">customer's</tref> <tref>payment agent</tref>
receives a payment request to send funds to RetailCo. Upon approval by
the customer, the transmission of funds are initiated from the
customer's financial account to RetailCo's financial account.
          </li>
          <li>
Payment Processor POV (<tref>payee</tref>-initiated payment): A MerchCo
<tref>merchant</tref> receives a
<a href="#proof-of-payment-hold-or-funds">proof of hold</a> from a
<tref title="customer">customer's</tref> <tref>payment agent</tref>.
The proof of hold proves that the customer has a valid
<tref>payment instrument</tref> for a recognized
<tref>payment scheme</tref>, and also proves that the customer has
given consent for the payment. The merchant forwards the message to MerchCo.
The transmission of funds are initiated from the customer's financial account
to the merchant's financial account.
<span class="issue">this flow isn't represented in the basic flow above,
is that ok? Or should we have all possible alternate flows for the use
case documented?</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>
        <p>
All payments start somewhere and they typically follow the same basic flow:
1) a <tref>payer</tref> requests a product or service, 2) the
<tref>payee</tref> advertises the final price for the product or service, and
3) the payer initiates payment to the payee. This use case explores the
initiation of a payment from the <tref>customer</tref>, <tref>merchant</tref>,
and <tref>payment processor</tref> perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>
A payment request contains all of the details necessary to perform a purchase
including:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
an optional list of requested products or services (see the Offers use case
<span class="issue">not yet integrated</span>),
          </li>
          <li>
the exchange value (price) for the products/services
(see the Offers use case <span class="issue">not yet integrated</span>),
          </li>
          <li>
the acceptable
<tref title="payment scheme">payment schemes</tref> (see the
<a href="#choice-of-payment-instrument">choice of payment instrument</a>
use case), and
          </li>
          <li>
a cryptographically verifiable signature on the important data in the
payment request (see Digital Signatures use case
<span class="issue">not yet integrated</span>).
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
The payment request is an extensible, cryptographically verifiable,
self-contained document that can be used interchangeably with any
<tref>payment agent</tref> and <tref>payment processor</tref>.
        </p>
        <p class="issue">
Stephane Boyera has raised a concern that this use case pulls in a bit too
much about the choice of payment instrument and the type of payments (push-based,
token-based, credit-card info exchange). He suggests that it may be better to
break this into a meta-use case.

The <tref title="customer">customer's</tref> <tref>payment agent</tref> has
delivered a
<a href="#proof-of-payment-hold-or-funds">proof of hold</a> or

to the <tref>merchant</tref>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <!-- section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
A messaging format that can encapsulate a list of goods and services being
sold and the current value required to acquire the goods and services.
          </li>
          <li>
The messaging format should be extensible (e.g. Linked Data, JSON-LD).
          </li>
          <li>
The messaging format should be cryptographically verifiable (e.g. via
digital signatures, PKI).
          </li>

    <section>
      <h3>Partially Omitting Personal Information</h3>
      <p>
Leveraging variable degrees of pseudo-anonymity based on the requirements of the
payment transaction.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Tibor orders assorted chocolates from an online candy store. The store only needs Tibor's verified shipping address and a proof of payment to send him the chocolates. The verified shipping address and the proof of payment are made in a single request to Tibor's Payment Agent and both are delivered to the online candy store. Tibor's privacy is protected from the candy store, which did not require Tibor's name, email address, or any other personally identifying information to complete the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: An online candy store gets an order for assorted chocolates. The store requests a verified shipping address and a proof of payment from the customer in order to send the goods. After receiving both, the store ships the goods to the customer, not exposing themselves to any risk of accidentally leaking their customer's personal information of payment data.
          </li>
          <li>
Payment Processor POV: PayCo is required to keep a certain amount of information on their customers for anti-money laundering / know your customer regulatory purposes. When a customer performs a transaction with a merchant, they would like to reduce the amount of information that's transmitted to the merchant while ensuring that they stay compliant with regulations. This enables the customer to stay pseudo-anonymous when dealing with merchants, but ensure that law enforcement have recourse in the event of illegal activity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>
        <p>
Protecting an individual's privacy when performing transactions on the Web is an important concern. This use case attempts to ensure that transaction privacy is a fundamental part of any Web-based payment mechanism.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>

        <ul>
          <li>
A payment protocol that is capable of transmitting a proof of purchase that does not contain any personally identifiable information.
          </li>
          <li>
A credential protocol that is capable of transmitting the minimum aspects of an entity's identity, such as a shipping address, or e-mail address, to complete a transaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Choosing a Payment Instrument</h3>
      <p>
When a <tref>payer</tref> intends to make a payment, they are given a choice
to pick among the intersection of the
<tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref> they have available
to them and the payment instruments that are accepted by the
<tref>payee</tref>. When a selection is made, the payment request is routed
to the appropriate <tref>payment agent</tref>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Daniel wants to pay the taxi fare with his credit card.
The cab company promotes
the payment via its web site which offers, on Daniel's smartphone, to choose
between several options offering different payment instruments: 1) the basic
credit card (Visa, MasterCard, etc.) schemes provided by his
cloud-based credit card wallet; 2) or an indirect aggregator
(PayPal, Google checkout) installed as a native phone application; 3) or
a locally installed cryptocurrency wallet application.
          </li>
          <li>
Customer POV: Amantha downloads the latest version of her favorite game.
It's only a couple
of euros that she'd like to pay on top of her telecom operator's bill. The game
store web site accepts payment via credit card and operator billing. Amantha
selects the "operator billing" payment option.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: A CrowdFundCo customer has just approved a donation to a
third party. To complete the donation, CrowdFundCo provides its
available payment instruments; Bitcoin and PayPal. The customer has
a VISA credit card and a MasterCard credit card in a single payment agent
as well as a Bitcoin payment agent. The payment request is forwarded
to the Bitcoin payment agent.
          </li>
          <li class="issue">
The following example is marked for removal because it conflates offering
a new payment instrument w/ the selection of a payment instrument:

Ricardo would like to pay for clothes at ThreadCo, a brick-and-mortar retailer,
using software on his mobile phone. He taps his phone to checkout and notices
that the purchase would be less expensive if he uses a department store
digital credit card to complete the purchase. He applies for the card using a
provided link, is approved for the digital credit card card, and completes the
checkout process using his new card.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>

        <p>
In order to ensure a level playing field and a vibrant ecosystem of
<tref title="payment agent">payment agents</tref> and
<tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref>, it's important that
a mechanism exists to enable the <tref>payer</tref> to easily select between a
variety of competing options.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
The rest of the text in this section aren't really motivations, they're more
like details about the things that should be provided by a payment
instrument selection mechanism.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
Each <tref>payment instrument</tref> is registered with a set of attributes in
order to filter, sort, and display them including the
<tref>payment scheme</tref> with which it is associated.
          </li>
          <li>
Each <tref>payment agent</tref> registers the
<tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref> and
associated <tref title="payment scheme">payment schemes</tref> it is able to
provide.
          </li>
          <li>
The payment initiation process can discover the locally registered
<tref title="payment agent">payment agents</tref> and their
supported <tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref>
and <tref title="payment scheme">payment schemes</tref>.
          </li>
          <li>
Optionally, new payment instruments may be offered to the <tref>payer</tref> by
the <tref>payee</tref> and provided as options by their
<tref>payment agent</tref>.
          </li>
          <li>
Each <tref>merchant</tref> provides a list of acceptable
<tref title="payment scheme">payment schemes</tref>, and if applicable,
specific <tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref>
within each scheme (such as Visa and MasterCard only).
          </li>
          <li>
A <tref>payment agent</tref> may attempt to optimize payment instruments on
behalf of the <tref>customer</tref> by selecting for payment speed,
loyalty benefits, price, or other conveniences.
          </li>
          <li>
Over time, each <tref>customer</tref> iteratively builds a list of preferred
payment instruments for their commonly used
<tref title="merchant">merchants</tref>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="issue">
How are multiple payment instruments handled? Is there such a thing? There are
two main approaches so far. The first is to treat loyalty cards, coupons,
discount cards, and other similar items as types of
<tref title="credential">credentials</tref> and the
<tref>payment instrument</tref> as the mechanism that moves the value. The
second is to explore how multiple payment instruments may be mixed together
from different providers to complete a transaction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
The <tref>payer</tref>, via the software that initiated the payment
(such as the user agent coupled with the payment agent),
and the <tref>payee</tref> are able to negotiate a
<tref>payment instrument</tref> with respect to their preferences and
support capabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
A data format, which would be a part of the payment request, that expresses
the list of available payment instruments that the
<tref>merchant</tref> accepts.
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol that enables the <tref>payment agent</tref> to suggest new
<tref>payment instruments</tref> to the <tref>customer</tref> based on

      <h3>Making a Payment Without Registering</h3>
      <p>
A <tref>payer</tref> goes to a <tref>payee</tref> storefront and initiates a payment without having to go through any registration process. During the payment process, the <tref>payer</tref> chooses which information to share with the <tref>payee</tref> which the <tref>payee</tref> then uses to identify the <tref>payer</tref> if future payments are made.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Lilith finds a song that she really likes through one of her favorite music blogs. Without registering with the blog, or the artists website, she initiates a purchase and is sent to the artist's website to show the proof of purchase and download the song. At no point did Lilith have to register for a user account, enter her credit card number, or email address.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: A proof of purchase for a song is shown to a merchant website. The proof of purchase is validated and the merchant website provides a download for the customer.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>
        <p>
There are a large number of "paywall" websites on the Web that require registration to use. In many cases, if the site isn't regularly visited by the customer, they abandon the transaction when they see the paywall requirement. Providing a mechanism to sell an inexpensive item to a customer without requiring registration would be of great benefit to not only the merchants selling goods and services, but customers that would like to avoid lengthy registration processes.

      <h3>Payer-initiated Funds Transfer</h3>
      <p>
When a <tref>customer</tref> wants to make a purchase, the
<tref>merchant</tref> presents the customer with an electronic invoice which
in turn can be presented to a <tref>payment processor</tref>.  The payment
processor then provides a validated proof-of-payment to the merchant via
the customer's device or directly to the merchant.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: John goes to CandyCart.com and clicks “buy” to purchase
chocolates. His browser re-directs him to his <tref>payment processor</tref>
which asks him to approve the purchase. He approves the purchase, his
payment processor transmits the funds to the receiving account, and his
browser is re-directed back to CandyCart.com with the proof of payment.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: A <tref>customer</tref> selects 5 items to purchase.
The <tref>merchant</tref> system presents an electronic invoice (either a total
only or with a breakdown of the transaction), including the merchant's
identifier, to the <tref title="customer">customer's</tref> device.
The customer's device returns a proof of payment that is digitally signed
with the customer's
<tref title="payment processor">payment processor's</tref> private key.
          </li>
          <li>
3-Corner Payment Processor POV: A <tref>customer</tref> sends an electronic invoice,
including the <tref>merchant</tref> and customer identifiers, to the
<tref>payment processor</tref>. The customer and the merchant use the
same payment processor. The payment processor checks the customer and
merchant for validity, posts the requested amount to the merchant's account,
and then generates a proof of payment for the merchant. The payment processor
then returns a signed digest of the invoice plus a digest of the proof of
payment to the customer's device. The customer's device delivers the
proof-of-payment to the merchant system to prove that funds have been
transferred.
          </li>
          <li>
4-Corner Payment Processor POV: A <tref>customer</tref> sends an electronic
invoice, including the <tref>merchant</tref> and customer identifiers, to the
<tref>payment processor</tref>. The customer and the merchant use different
payment processors. The payment processor checks the customer and
merchant for validity, and initiates a transfer of the requested amount
to the merchant's account via a payment clearing mechanism. Once the
payment processor has received a verification that the payment message was
received by the acquirer, it then generates a proof of payment for the merchant.
The payment processor then returns a signed digest of the invoice plus a digest
of the proof of payment to the customer's device. The customer's device
delivers the proof-of-payment to the merchant system to prove that funds
have been transferred.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>
        <p>
For this use case, the <tref>customer</tref> asks the
<tref>payment processor</tref> to initiate payment to the <tref>merchant</tref>
directly, preventing the need for sensitive customer information to be shared
with the <tref>merchant</tref>, which keeps the merchant out of "PCI scope."
No direct communication between merchant and payment provider is required for
this use case. It may be possible to create an electronic receipt format
that satisfies the requirements for this use case as well as others.
        </p>

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>

All acquirers must have an available public key.
          </li>
          <li>
All <tref title="payment processor">payment processors</tref> must have an
available public key.

      <h3>Limiting Payee-initiated Payments</h3>
      <p>
A payer visits a payee's website and initiates a payment. The payer's payment processor presents them with an option to assign a pay-as-you-go token with a specific spending limit (and/or other limitations) for future purchases with the payee. An option is also presented to require the display of a receipt when a purchase occurs (and/or other interactions), or to perform the purchase in the background with no interactive purchase process required.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Yanos visit's his favorite financial news site, which requires articles to be purchased if the customer does not have a subscription. Yanos initiates a purchase. The website, in the payment request, requests a multi-use payment token from Yanos' payment processor to spend up to $15 a month on Yanos' behalf when he purchases certain for-pay articles. Yanos' payment processor asks him if he would just like to perform a one-time purchase, or grant the payment token to the news site. Yanos doesn't want to be bothered to approve a $0.50 purchase, as he does many of them on the website, so he authorizes the initial payment and also authorizes the multi-use payment token. The multi-use payment token is delivered to the financial news site along with proof-of-purchase for the initial article he intended to buy.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: An online video game company following a freemium business model would like to enable in-app purchases for their content. In order to do so, they would like to request a multi-use payment token from their customer. They enable a button in their game that requests a multi-use payment token and when a customer approves it, the company stores it in their systems. The multi-use payment token is only good for 3 months and has a spending limit that is set by the customer.
          </li>
          <li>
Payment Processor POV: A payee's payment processor receives a request for a multi-use payment token from a payer via the payee's device. The payment processor ensures that the details of the payment token are acceptable to the payee, enables them to add constraints to the payment token, and upon approval, grants a unique identifier for the payment token to be returned to the merchant. The payment token is always linked between a payer's source account and a payee's destination account such that the theft of the payment token does not result in the ability of the thief to move money from the payer's source account to an arbitrary payee.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>

        <p>
There are a number of types of purchases that don't require the full attention of the payer when they happen. For example, an in-game purchase for an item that costs $0.05 is not necessary until a pre-set limit set by the payer is reached. It is important to not make the payment experience cumbersome for markets that perform micro-payments, or require the processing of many repetitive payments. If the payment authorization step can be automated to the point of disappearing without creating a bad customer experience or generating fraud, then it should be eliminated.

      <h3>Proof of Payment, Hold, or Funds</h3>
      <p>
A <tref>payer</tref> intiates a transaction for a good or service from a <tref>payee</tref> resulting in a standardized, cryptographically signed, machine-readable proof-of-payment, proof-of-hold, or proof-of-funds. Entities involved in the transaction (<tref>payer</tref> or any <tref>payee</tref>) may then use the proof to assess whether or not the <tref>payer</tref> should have access to the good or service.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Jeff buys a lot of heavy metal music through the "Buy this track" function on his car radio. When he buys a new car, he wants to transfer his collection and provides all of the proof-of-payment data to show that he has already paid for the songs.
          </li>
          <li>
Customer POV: Willie buys e-tickets for a football game, but his mobile phone is stolen while standing in the queue. Since he has a receipt and identifies himself, he can still get in to watch the match.
          </li>
          <li>
Customer POV: Renne checks into a hotel and is asked for a deposit for any damages to the room. She uses her phone to provide a proof-of-hold until she checks out of the hotel, at which time the hold on her funds will be released.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: Rockinradio, smoothSounds, and classicClassic are independent specialised music retailers. They accept proof-of-purchase from each other to provide a track that is in their online catalogue even if it was originally bought from another provider.

      <h3>Refunds</h3>
      <p>
The funds that are transmitted from <tref>payer</tref> to <tref>payee</tref> are reversed after a decision by a <tref>merchant</tref>, <tref>regulatory authority</tref>, or <tref>payment processor</tref>.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Pele buys a slice of pizza at a local restaurant and is accidentally charged for five slices of pizza. He notices the mistake after he pays and requests a refund, which the restaurant manager approves. The overcharged funds are returned to his account.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: A customer claims that a blender that they purchased online was faulty and returns the product to the merchant. The merchant provides the customer with a refund in the form of store credit based on the return policy.
          </li>
          <li>
Regulator POV: A financial crimes regulator identifies a criminal syndicate that is operating via a number of fake identities. The fake identities are flagged and an electronic message is sent to all payment processors to reverse all payments sent to the fake identities.

The following use cases have been identified by the Web Payments Interest
Group as medium-priority items.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Applying Coupons and Loyalty Cards to a Payment</h3>
      <p>
A <tref>payee</tref> can associate a membership card, coupon, or similar token with a transaction to receive a discount or other benefits.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: Cory shops for groceries at his local ChowMart. When he starts the checkout process via the automated kiosk, the machine asks him to tap his phone to transmit his ChowSavingsCard info to get discounts on items he's purchasing. He taps his phone, selects his card and taps his phone again to transmit the card information to the kiosk, which shows him how much of a discount he is receiving because of the card.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: ChickenHut requests loyalty cards from frequent customers in order to provide discounts. When customers tap their phone, a cryptographically verifiable token that was issued by ChickenHut is transmitted from the phone to the point of sale device and verified for authenticity.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>
        <p>
Coupons and loyalty cards are two discount mechanisms that may be used by a customer before performing a final payment. While coupons and loyalty cards vary wildly in their associated benefits, a merchant or manufacturer must ensure that each one is authentic. In order to ensure the authenticity of a coupon, loyalty card, or information stored therein, it is important that all information is cryptographically verifiable. It is also important for the point-of-sale devices to be able to add information to the locally-stored loyalty cards for use in off-line scenarios.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
A data format for expressing a coupon.
          </li>
          <li>
A data format for expressing a loyalty card.
          </li>
          <li>
The data format should be extensible (e.g. Linked Data, JSON-LD).

          <li>
The data format should be cryptographically verifiable (e.g. via digital signatures, PKI).
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol for transmitting the coupon or loyalty card from the payer to the payee.
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol for adding cryptographically verifiable information to a loyalty card.

      <h3>Performing a Payment in Multiple Phases</h3>
      <p>
<tref title="transaction">Transactions</tref> over a certain amount may require
a preliminary check on the availability of funds to complete the transaction.
These transactions may also have a provision to perform a hold on the funds
until the product or service is delivered and the transaction is complete.
      </p>

      <section>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Customer POV: George pulls up to a pump at a petrol station. His in-vehicle
application recognizes the station location and the pump, and asks if he wants
to approve a fill up. He answers "yes" and is prompted for which method of
payment he would like to use. He makes his selection, exits the vehicle,
lifts the nozzle, selects the grade of fuel, and fills his car. When he
returns to his vehicle, an electronic receipt for the purchase is displayed
by his in-vehicle application.
          </li>
          <li>
Customer POV: Doris uses her mobile application to approve fuel fill-up for
her van. She realizes after exiting her vehicle that the site is not ADA
compliant, and so she cannot access the pumps. She uses her mobile application
to cancel the transaction.
          </li>
          <li>
Merchant POV: FuelCo's in-store control system gets a message from a
<tref>payment processor</tref> that pump 14 should be approved for a fill-up.
The message includes a single use cryptogram that can be used to prove
authorization. The equipment arms the pump and allows the fueling to proceed.
On completion, the merchant system sends the actual amount to pay along with
the single use cryptogram back to the payment processor.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Motivations</h4>
        <p>
Delivering services or products that are difficult to "undo", such
as performing an oil change, dispensing fuel, or renting a car, are examples
of situations which may require a two-part transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
This use case highlights the need for a two part transaction. The
first part either checks availability or reserves funds, and the second
completes the transaction with the actual amount. There are many different
ways these two segments can be completed.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
A protocol and data format that enables a device to directly send a
pre-authorization request to a <tref>customer</tref>, process it through
the customer's <tref>payment processor</tref>, and receive the proof of
pre-authorization from either the customer device or the customer's
payment processor.
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol and data format that enables the pre-authorization request to be
processed entirely with the <tref title="merchant">merchant's</tref> payment
processing system.
          </li>
          <li>
A protocol that enables the merchant to request a specific hold amount, the
amount to be approved or denied by the customer, and the hold of the funds to
be either approved of denied by the <tref>payment processor</tref>.
