This document is a prioritized list of Web payments use cases.
Guided by these use cases, the W3C Web Payments Interest Group
plans to derive architecture and associated technology
requirements to integrate payments into the Open Web
Platform. That work will form the basis of conversations with W3C
groups and the broader payments industry about what standards
(from W3C or other organizations) will be necessary to fulfill the
use cases and make payments over the Web easier and more secure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
    <p>
This document is a work in progress and is being released early and often
using an agile process; it is incomplete.
    </p>
  <p>
The Web Payments IG has only had the opportunity to review a handful of the
40+ use cases, 120+ requirements, and hundreds of pages of
payments research submitted to the group via various other standards group
output such as ISO20022, research documents from X9 and the US Federal Reserve,
documents from the Web Payments Community Group, and input from the
general public. Our desire is to align with the larger payments industry
when it's possible to do so. Expect this document to be rapidly iterated upon
with that desire in mind.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
ECommerce is thriving and continues to expand. However
fragmentation of payment systems is limiting the growth potential
as are problems —both real and perceived— such as
fraud and usability.
    </p>

    <p>
Because the Web is ubiquitous, strengthening support for Web
payments has the potential to create new opportunities for
businesses and customers. Mobile devices are already transforming
the industry by supplanting physical payment cards in proximity
payments, voucher distribution, and identification when people
authenticate to a scanner, point of sale, or access gate. Although
we are seeing innovation in mobile payment systems, the lack of
standards makes it more difficult to adapt to new payment
approaches or integrate new payment providers.
    </p>

    <p>
To achieve greater interoperability among merchants and their
customers, payment providers, software vendors, mobile operators,
and payment networks, the W3C Web Payments Interest Group is
developing a roadmap for standards to improve the interoperability
of payments on the Web, including
<tref title="payment scheme">payment schemes</tref> in use today
(such as electronic cheques, credit cards, direct debit, and
cryptocurrencies) and those of the future. The roadmap will be derived
from the use cases listed below.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Why This Work is Important</h3>
      <p>
There are many people around the world that today's financial system does not
reach. These people are called the world's unbanked (or underbanked). The
unbanked often live pay cheque to pay cheque, do not have access to savings
accounts or low-fee cheque cashing services, lines of credit, or a way of saving
for their future. Being unable to plan for one's financial future often results
in short-term thinking, which creates a viscious cycle of not being able to
escape one's situation. Not being able to participate in the financial system
creates unintended inequities that create waste and results in a net loss
for society.
      </p>
      <p>
However, some of the shortcomings of today's financial system could be
addressed via technological improvements. For example, there is a considerable
overlap between the unbanked and underbanked population and access to advanced
mobile phones and the Web. If financial services could be provided via the
Web in a standardized way to people with mobile phones, we could start to see
an improvement in the lives of these individuals and families.
      </p>
      <p>
The Web Payments work is not just about making payments easier, faster,
more secure, and more innovative. Extending the current financial system to
reach further helps an ever increasing number of people plan for their future,
become long-term thinkers, and thus contributes to a greater net gain
for society.

      <h3>How this Document is Organized</h3>

      <p>
This document is organized as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Section 2 defines basic payment terms.
        </li>
        <li>
Section 3 describes a common payment flow at a high
level. The group expects to work on additional
payment flows in future work.
        </li>
        <li>
Section 4 is a specific narrative, labeled according
to the steps of section 3. Section 7 describes
additional familiar narratives to give a more complete picture
of how the payment phases apply.
        </li>
        <li>
Section 6 lists the use cases, short scenarios that cover
diverse aspects of each payment step.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Each use case has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
A title and short description.
        </li>
        <li>
Goals. How the use case advances one or more of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/ExecSummary#Goals">goals
for an interoperable Web payments framework</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Motivation. This is commentary to help explain why the use
case has been included, including how it relates to similar use cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Each use case may also have notes on:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
Security/Privacy. Security or privacy issues that may arise through this use
case.
        </li>
        <li>
Exceptions. Considerations in the case of specific exceptions (e.g., if a
user pays with a voucher and the transaction fails, the user's voucher should
be restored).
        </li>
        <li>
Accessibility. Accessibility considerations (e.g., in multi-factor
authentication, management of biometrics in the case of users with some
disabilities).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
The Interest Group (currently) regards some of the use cases as "essential" to
addressing their
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/ExecSummary#Goals">goals</a> and
others as "non-essential."

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the Web
Payments space by using specific terms to discuss particular concepts. This
terminology is included below and linked to throughout the document to aid
the reader:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tdef>entity</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
A person, organization, or software agent that is capable of interacting with
the world.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payer</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
An <tref>entity</tref> that provides a source of funds as required by a
<tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payee</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
An <tref>entity</tref> that receives funds as required by a
<tref>transaction</tref>.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>transaction</tdef></dt>
      <dd>

      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payment scheme</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
Sets of rules and technical standards for the execution of payment transactions
that have to be followed by adhering entities

<tref>payee</tref>. Examples: Corporate Visa card, personal Visa card, a bitcoin account, a PayPal account, an Alipay account, etc.
      </dd>
      <dt><tdef>payment processor</tdef></dt>
      <dd>
Submits and processes payments using a particular
<tref>payment instrument</tref> to a payment network. Examples: Stripe, Authorize.net, Atos, FedACH</li>
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">
There are a number of financial industry standards (such as
ISO20022, ISO12812, various X9 standards, PCI DSS, and others) that
define payment terms. The Web Payments Interest Group has as a goal to
make use of industry-defined terms in its deliverables. At the same time,
the group has as a goal that these use cases may be understood by both
payment industry professionals and the broader Web community. Thus, our
definitions are simplified and few in number here, but the group is
also developing a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/GlossaryReference">more complete glossary</a>
with detailed definitions and mappings to industry-defined terms.

    <h2>An Overview of the Payment Phases</h2>

    <p>There are many types of transactions in the world of payments,
including person-to-business, business-to-business,
government-to-person, person-to-government, and
person-to-person. In this document we focus on the
interactions between a <tref>payer</tref> and a <tref>payee</tref>,
either of which could be a person, business, government, or software
agent), which we organize into four phases:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
Negotiation of Payment Terms
      </li>
      <li>
Negotiation of Payment Instruments
      </li>
      <li>
Payment Processing
      </li>
      <li>
Delivery of Product/Receipt
      </li>
    </ol>

<p>The descriptions below only discuss the interactions between the
payer and the payee. We do not expose the low-level exchanges between
banks, card associations, or other back-end "payment clearing" parties
in a transaction. Those details will be discussed in the Interest
Group's work on architecture and
requirements.</p>

 <p>Each phase below consists of a series of steps.
The details of each step vary by <tref>payment scheme</tref>. Some steps may
not be relevant at certain times (e.g., depending on
<tref>payment scheme</tref> or <tref>transaction</tref> specifics).
Some steps may happen in a slightly different order in some cases.
For example, some purchases do not involve a proof of funds or proof of
hold. ACH and SEPA payment schemes generally do not support the verification of
available funds, thus in these payment schemes the particular proof of funds
step is skipped.
  </p>
    <p>
It is also important to note that these phases and steps may be be interrupted
at various times (e.g., one party drops out, or exceptions occur like
insufficient funds, refunds, or a regulatory block). While these phases are an
approximation of the general flow of all payments, they are helpful in
structuring the use cases such that it is easy to figure out to which part of
the payment process a particular use case belongs.
    </p>

 <p>While these four phases may apply more or less well to a variety
of other payment scenarios such as refunds or person-to-person
payments, those topics are not the current focus of the group.  We
plan to address them directly in <a href="#future-work">future
work</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Terms</h3>
      <p>
The first phase of the payment process is where the <tref>payer</tref> and the
<tref>payee</tref> negotiate the terms of the payment.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>. The <tref>payer</tref> discovers the
<tref title="payee">payee's</tref> offer (e.g., by browsing a Web page or
from a native application).
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>. The <tref>payer</tref> and the
<tref>payee</tref> agree to what will be purchased, for how much,
in what currency, how the <tref>payer</tref> will be authenticated by the
<tref>payee</tref>, which payment schemes are acceptable, etc. The
<tref>payee</tref> may generate an invoice for the <tref>payer</tref>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>. The <tref>payer</tref>
discovers and applies any loyalty programs, coupons, and other special offers
to the payment terms.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>
      <p>
The second phase of the payment process is used to determine which
<tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref> the
<tref>payer</tref> will use to transfer funds to the <tref>payee</tref>.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>. The <tref>payer</tref>
discovers the <tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref> that
are accepted by the <tref>payee</tref>. These will vary depending on the types
of <tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref> that the
<tref>payee</tref> accepts.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>. The <tref>payee</tref>
selects one or more <tref title="payment instrument">payment instruments</tref>
that are available to the <tref>payer</tref> and are accepted by the
<tref>payee</tref>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>. The issuer of the
<tref>payment instrument</tref> authenticates the <tref>payer</tref>, who then
consents to pay. Note: This authentication with the
<tref>payment processor</tref> is distinct from any authentication required
by the <tref>payee</tref> (e.g., a merchant verifying a password on a
<tref title="payer">payer's</tref> user account).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
      <p>
The third phase of the payment process is used to initiate the transfer of
funds. Depending on the <tref>payment instrument</tref>, the transfer of funds
may be verified immediately or may take several days to be verified.
      </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>. Depending on the
<tref>payment instrument</tref>, the <tref>payer</tref> (e.g., when using
PayPal), the <tref>payee</tref> (e.g., when using a credit card), or other
party (e.g., bank) initiates processing.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>. The <tref>payee</tref> may
need to provide a proof of funds or a proof of hold to the <tref>payer</tref>
before finalizing payment and delivery of the product.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>. The <tref>payer</tref> receives
proof that the transfer of funds has been authorized.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>. The <tref>payment scheme</tref>
determines the details of payment clearing and settlement, and transfer times
that may vary from near-realtime to multiple days.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Delivery of Product/Receipt</h3>
      <p>
The fouth phase of the payment process is used to complete the transaction by
providing the <tref>payer</tref> with a receipt and/or the product that was
purchased.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Product</strong>. The <tref>payer</tref> receives goods or
services immediately, at a later date, automatically on a recurring basis,
etc. depending on the terms of the purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Receipt</strong>. Depending on the
<tref title="payment scheme">payment scheme(s)</tref></tref> chosen, there are
various ways and times that a receipt may be delivered (e.g., credit card
receipt, digital proof of purchase, encrypted line-item receipt, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="phases-overview">A Simple Example of the Payment Phases</h2>
    <p>
The following scenario is provided to aid the reader in understanding how the
phases of the payment process apply to a real world situation. In this scenario,
we follow Jill, who seeks a new outfit for a party. She selects items from
PayToParty, which is a brick-and-mortar store with an online presence.
She chooses how to pay and the items are delivered to her home on the
following day.
    </p>

    <p>
See the appendix for <a href="#additional-examples">additional examples of
the payment phases</a>.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Purchase Terms</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>: Jill begins her purchase at
home on her laptop, where she browses the items on the PayToParty Web
site. On the way to work the next morning, she explores the catalog
further from a native app on her smart phone. Jill can't decide
whether the dress displayed online is blue with black stripes or white
with gold stripes, so during her lunch break, she drops into the
PayToParty store near her office. She spots a few more items that
she thinks she'd like to purchase, but decides to wait until later to
make the purchase.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>: That same evening at home,
Jill logs into her account on the PayToParty Web site, adding her
preferred items to her shopping cart. The total price appears on the
page.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>: As Jill prepares to
check out, PayToParty offers her a discount of 10% if she uses the store's
loyalty card to pay.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>: Given where Jill lives,
PayToParty offers her payment by credit card, debit card, the PayToParty
loyalty card and PayPal, but not Jill's favorite cryptocurrency (which she
uses on other sites).
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>: Jill pushes the "Pay now"
button and is presented with a number of options to pay, including her
credit card, her PayToParty loyalty card (which is highlighted to remind her
of the discount), and a PayPal account. There is also a gift card from
PayToParty that she received for her birthday, but she chooses not to
use it for this purchase.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>: Jill selects
the PayToParty loyalty card, which she enabled with theft-protection,
and is asked to input a code that is sent to her phone before the purchase
can be completed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>. PayToParty receives a

submits the message to their payment processor, requesting a
proof of hold for the funds.

<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>. PayToParty
receives a proof of hold on Jills fund's for the purchase price of
the goods. The PayToParty night-shift employees begin packing her purchased
items for delivery the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>. Once Jill's package is ready to
go, PayToParty exchanges the proof of hold for a proof of payment by
re-submitting the request to the payment network. They receive a proof of
payment from the payment processor.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>. Since Jill's PayToParty loyalty card
operates as a credit card, the PayToParty site is immediately credited with
the purchase amount and the funds will be swept into their bank account at the
end of the week. Jill will pay off the credit line at the end of the month.

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>

    <p>
The use cases below rely on a number of assumptions that are not
detailed in the use cases but that will be explored in more detail in
the architecture and requirements documents.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
<strong>Connectivity</strong>. Connectivity requirements vary according to
use case. The types of connections a device may utilize include Internet
connectivity, proxied connections through short-range radio transmissions,
and proximity connections over a technology such as Near-Field Communication
(NFC) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE). Some use cases assume no
connectivity (e.g., user is temporarily unable to connect to a mobile phone
network or a WiFi hotspot).
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Registered Payment Instruments</strong>. In order for the
<tref>payer</tref> to select and utilize payment instruments, they must be
registered in some way and discoverable by a browser, native application,
or other software.
      </li>
      <li>
<strong>Security</strong>. Keys, encryption, and other security technology
must be used to secure sensitive information. It is important that sensitive
information is not transmitted to parties that do not absolutely need to
know the information in order to complete the transaction.</li>
      <li>
<strong>Identity</strong>. There will be a consistent, interoperable
identifier used to identify the participants and accounts in a Web Payments
transaction.

In current online and offline payment transactions, biometric authentication
can be used to instead of password-based authentication. Biometrics can be
utilized on Point of Sale terminals, mobile, and wearable devices.
Web payment systems based on biometrics could achieve more reliable information

facial recognition, can also be used to augment password-based
authentication mechanisms.

One of the biggest security flaws of payee-initiated payments is that all the
information necessary to initiate a transaction from the
<tref title="payer">payer's</tref> financial account is typically transmitted
to the <tref>payee</tref>. For example, credit card information along with
expiration date, name, and CVV2 code are transmitted and could be intercepted
by rogue software running on the <tref title="payer">payer's</tref> servers.
Special attention should be paid to ensuring that this sort of broken security
model isn't supported by a Web Payments solution. For example, at a minimum,
credit card tokenization such as EMVCo's solution should be supported
alongside other tokenization solutions.

      <h3>PayPal / Alipay / Google Wallet Payment</h3>
      <p>
The following scenario outlines an ideal payment experience using a
<tref>payer</tref>-initiated payment, also known as a "push-payment" or
"three corner model payment". In this scenario, Anna is buying an airline
ticket from a booking website and during the payment process she uses her
fingerprint instead of a password to authorize the payment.
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation of Purchase Terms</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>: Anna searches for a flight on
the booking website. She finds a flight for the ideal price and time.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>: Anna selects the flight and agrees to the
terms and service associated with the ticket.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>: <em>Not applicable to
this particular use case.</em>
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>: The booking website takes
Alipay, Visa, MasterCard, and China UnionPay for payment.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>: Anna chooses Alipay for
payment.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>: Anna logs in the Alipay
with her account name and password. Anna is told that she will pay for the
airline ticket with 600RMB and she confirms it. Anna uses her fingerprint to
approve the payment.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>: Anna's Alipay wallet initiates
the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>: <em>Not applicable to
this particular use case.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>: Alipay initiates the payment to
the booking website based on Anna's prior fingerprint-based authorization.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>: The booking website gets a message
from Alipay that the transfer is complete.
        </p>

      <h3>Delivery of Product/Receipt</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Delivery of Receipt</strong>: The booking website sees that Anna's
airline ticket order has been paid and sends a receipt massage to her
digital wallet.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Delivery of Product</strong>: The booking website sends an email to
Anna with the flight information including the airline, flight number,
departure time, and gate number.

      <h3>Bitcoin Payment</h3>
      <p>
The following scenario outlines an ideal payment experience using Bitcoin, or a
Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency. In this scenario, Lenne is buying a pair of
alpaca socks from an online retailer using a "buy one, get one free" coupon.
The socks are shipped to her home address.
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation of Purchase Terms</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>: Lenne searches for "warm socks,
locally sourced" in her favorite search engine. A pair of Alpaca socks come up
as the first hit as the Alpaca's are nearby where she lives and the online
store (AlpacaToesCo) provides local delivery. She has a coupon in her
digital wallet for the store, but forgot long ago that it is there.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>: Lenne goes to AlpacaToesCo and puts the
socks in her online shopping cart and is shown the price. Lenne provides her
shipping address to AlpacaToes.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>: When Lenne puts the socks
in her online shopping cart, she's reminded of the "buy one, get one free"
coupon she has in her wallet. She adds another pair of socks and continues
with the checkout process.
      </p>

      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>: The website takes Visa,
Ripple, and Bitcoin for payment.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>: Lenne has a Visa card
as well as a local Ripple wallet and a cloud-based Bitcoin wallet. Lenne
selects her cloud-based Bitcoin wallet.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>: Since the value of the
payment is less than $50, Lenne isn't asked for her two-factor authentication
device to approve the purchase.
      </p>

      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>: Lenne's cloud-based Bitcoin wallet
provider initiates the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>: <em>Not applicable to
this particular use case.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>: AlpacaToesCo is sent a message
from the Bitcoin cloud wallet notifying them that the transfer has been
initiated. Lenne is told that she will receive a notification when the
item is shipped.
        </p>
        <p>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>: AlpacaToesCo gets a message from the
Bitcoin cloud wallet that the transfer is complete. A Bitcoin transaction ID
is included in the message so that AlpacaToesCo can release the product when
the appropriate number of verifications are made on the transaction.
        </p>

      <h3>Delivery of Product/Receipt</h3>

      <p>
<strong>Delivery of Receipt</strong>: AlpacaToesCo sees 6 verifications on the
transaction in the Bitcoin blockchain and sends a receipt of sale to Lenne's
cloud wallet. The store notifies Lenne that they have shipped her package.
      </p>

      <p>
<strong>Delivery of Product</strong>: AlpacaToesCo ships the package of socks
to Lenne and she receives them the next day.
