This document is a prioritized list of Web payments use cases.
Guided by these use cases, the W3C Web Payments Interest Group
plans to derive architecture and associated technology
requirements to integrate payments into the Open Web
Platform. That work will form the basis of conversations with W3C
groups and the broader payments industry about what standards
(from W3C or other organizations) will be necessary to fulfill the
use cases and make payments over the Web easier and more secure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id='sotd'>
    <p>
This document is a work in progress and is being released early and often
using an agile process; it is incomplete.
    </p>
    <p>
The Web Payments IG has only had the opportunity to review a handful of the
40+ use cases, 120+ requirements, hundreds of pages of
payments research submitted to the group via various other standards group
output such as ISO20022, research documents from X9 and the US Federal Reserve,
documents from the Web Payments Community Group, and input from the
general public. Our desire is to align with the larger payments industry
when it's possible to do so. Expect this document to be rapidly iterated upon
with that desire in mind.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
ECommerce is thriving and continues to expand. However,
fragmentation of payment systems is limiting the growth potential
as are problems &mdash; both real and perceived &mdash; such as
fraud and usability.
    </p>

    <p>
Because the Web is ubiquitous, strengthening support for Web
payments has the potential to create new opportunities for
businesses and customers. Mobile devices are already transforming
the industry by supplanting physical payment cards in proximity
payments, voucher distribution, and identification when people
authenticate to a scanner, point of sale, or access gate. Although
we are seeing innovation in mobile payment systems, the lack of
standards makes it more difficult to adapt to new payment
approaches or integrate new payment providers.
    </p>

    <p>
The W3C Web Payments Interest Group is developing a roadmap for standards to
improve the interoperability of payments using Web technologies for both
online and brick-and-mortar (offline) scenarios. This will help achieve
greater interoperability among merchants and their customers,
payment providers, software vendors, mobile operators, native mobile
apps, and payment networks. The roadmap will include
<a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a> in use
today (such as electronic cheques, credit cards, direct debit, and
cryptocurrencies) and those of the future. The roadmap will be derived from
the use cases listed below.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Why This Work is Important</h3>
      <p>
The Web Payments work is not just about making payments easier, faster,
more secure, and more innovative. There are many people around the world that
today's financial system does not reach. These people are called the world's
unbanked (or underbanked). The unbanked often live pay cheque to pay cheque, do
not have access to savings accounts or low-fee cheque cashing services, lines
of credit, or a way of saving for their future. Being unable to plan for one's
financial future often results in a focus on the short-term, which creates a
vicious cycle of not being able to escape one's situation. Not being able to
participate in the financial system creates unintended inequities that create
waste and result in a net loss for society.
      </p>
      <p>
However, some of the shortcomings of today's financial system could be
addressed via technological improvements. For example, there is a considerable
overlap between the unbanked and underbanked population and access to advanced
mobile phones and the Web. By providing financial services to people with
mobile phones in a standardized way via the Web, we could see an improvement
in the financial health of these individuals and their families.
      </p>
      <p>
Extending the current financial system to reach further helps an ever
increasing number of people plan for their future, focus on the long-term, and
thus contributes to a greater net gain for society.

      <h3>How this Document is Organized</h3>

      <p>
This document is organized as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
Section 2 defines basic payment terms.
        </li>
        <li>
Section 3 describes a common payment flow at a high
level. The group expects to work on additional
payment flows in future work.
        </li>
        <li>
Section 4 is a specific narrative, labeled according
to the steps of section 3. Section 7 describes
additional familiar narratives to give a more complete picture
of how the payment phases apply.
        </li>
        <li>
Section 6 lists the use cases - short scenarios that cover
diverse aspects of each payment step.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Each use case has:
      </p>
      <ul>
          <li>
A title and short description.
        </li>
        <li>
Goals. How the use case advances one or more of the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/ExecSummary#Goals">goals
for an interoperable Web payments framework</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
Motivation. This is commentary to help explain why the use
case has been included, including how it relates to similar use cases.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
Each use case may also have notes on:
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
Security/Privacy. Security or privacy issues that may arise through this use
case.
        </li>
        <li>
Exceptions. Considerations in the case of specific exceptions (e.g., if a
user pays with a voucher and the <a>transaction</a> fails, the user's voucher
should be restored).
        </li>
        <li>
Accessibility. Accessibility considerations (e.g., in multi-factor
authentication, management of biometrics in the case of users with some
disabilities).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="issue">
The group seeks input from security, privacy, and accessibility experts.
Examples of desired groups to perform these reviews are, but are not
limited to: W3C Privacy Interest Group,
W3C Security Interest Group, W3C Web Accessibility Initiative and
Protocols and Formats Working Group, US Federal Reserve Security Panels,
X9 Security subgroups, and ISO security subgroups.
      </p>

      <p>
The Interest Group (currently) regards some of the use cases as "essential" to
addressing their
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/ExecSummary#Goals">goals</a> and
others as "non-essential."

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <p>
This document attempts to communicate the concepts outlined in the Web
Payments space by using specific terms to discuss particular concepts. This
terminology is included below and linked to throughout the document to aid
the reader:
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><dfn>entity</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
A person, organization, or software agent that is capable of interacting with
the world.

      <dt><dfn>transaction</dfn></dt>
      <dd>
An exchange of value (e.g., buying or selling something)
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p class="note">
There are a number of financial industry standards (such as
ISO20022, ISO12812, various X9 standards, PCI DSS, and others) that
define payment terms. The Web Payments Interest Group has as a goal to
make use of industry-defined terms in its deliverables. At the same time,
the group has as a goal that these use cases may be understood by both
payment industry professionals and the broader Web community. Thus, our
definitions are simplified and few in number here, but the group is
also developing a
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/IG/wiki/GlossaryReference">more complete glossary</a>
with detailed definitions and mappings to industry-defined terms.

    <h2>An Overview of the Payment Phases</h2>

    <p>There are many types of <a>transaction</a>s in the world of payments,
including person-to-business, business-to-business, business-to-person,
government-to-person, person-to-government, and
person-to-person. In this document we focus on the
interactions between a <a>payer</a> and a <a>payee</a>,
either of which could be a person, business, government, or software
agent), which we organize into four phases:</p>

    <p class="issue">
The group would like feedback related to the general structure of the payment
phases from individuals that worked on ISO20022, ISO12812, the
European Payment Commission, and
various X9 documents to ensure that the phases reflect business processes
outlined in financial standardization initiatives. Feedback from the general
public is also requested to see if non-payment professionals can navigate and
understand the document without prior payment industry knowledge.
    </p>

Payment Processing
        </li>
        <li>
Delivery of Product/Receipt and Refunds
        </li>
    </ol>

<p>The descriptions below only discuss the interactions between the
payer and the <a>payee</a>. We do not expose the low-level exchanges between
banks, card associations, or other back-end "payment clearing" parties
in a <a>transaction</a>. Those details will be discussed in the Interest
Group's work on architecture and
requirements.</p>

 <p>Each phase below consists of a series of steps.
The details of each step vary by <a>payment scheme</a>. Some steps may
not be relevant at certain times (e.g., depending on
<a>payment scheme</a> or <a>transaction</a> specifics).
For example, some  <a title="purchase">purchases</a> do not involve a proof of
funds or proof of hold. ACH and SEPA
<a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a> generally do not support the
verification of available funds, thus in these
<a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a> the particular proof of funds
step is skipped.
In some cases, steps may happen in a slightly different order than described below.
  </p>
    <p>
It is also important to note that these phases and steps may be interrupted
at various times (e.g., one party drops out, or exceptions occur like
insufficient funds or a regulatory block). While these phases are an
approximation of the general flow of all payments, they are helpful in
structuring the use cases such that it is easy to figure out to which part of
the payment process a particular use case belongs.
    </p>

 <p>While these four phases may apply more or less well to a variety
of other payment scenarios such as person-to-person
payments, those topics are not the current focus of the group.  We
plan to address them directly in <a href="#future-work">future
work</a>.</p>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Terms</h3>
      <p>
In the first phase of the payment process, the <a>payer</a> and the
<a>payee</a> negotiate the terms of the payment.
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>. The <a>payer</a> discovers the
<a title="payee">payee's</a> offer (e.g., by browsing a Web page or
from a native application).
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>. The <a>payer</a> and the
<a>payee</a> agree to what will be purchased, for how much,
in what currency, which <a title="payment scheme">payment schemes</a>
or loyalty programs are acceptable, etc. The <a>payee</a> may require the
<a>payer</a> to authenticate themselves. The <a>payee</a> may generate an
invoice for the <a>payer</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>. The <a>payer</a>
discovers and applies any loyalty programs, coupons, and other special offers
to the payment terms.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>
      <p>
In the second phase of the payment process, <a>payer</a> and
<a>payee</a> determine which
<a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a> the
<a>payer</a> will use to transfer funds to the <a>payee</a>.
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>. The <a>payer</a>
discovers the <a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a> that
are accepted by the <a>payee</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>. The <a>payer</a>
selects one or more <a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a>
that are available to the <a>payer</a> and are accepted by the
<a>payee</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>. The
<a title="payer">payer's</a> access to the <a>payment instrument</a>
is authenticated. The <a>payer</a> consents to pay. Note: This authentication
with the <a>payment processor</a> is distinct from any authentication required
by the <a>payee</a> (such as when a merchant requires a customer to
have an account and log in to the merchant's Web site).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
      <p>
The third phase of the payment process is used to initiate the transfer of
funds. Depending on the <a>payment instrument</a>, the transfer of funds
may be verified immediately or only after several days.
      </p>
       <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>. Depending on the
<a>payment instrument</a>, the <a>payer</a> (e.g., when using
PayPal or Yandex Money), the <a>payee</a> (e.g., when using a credit card), or other
party (e.g., bank) initiates processing.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>. The <a>payer</a> may
need to provide a proof of funds or a proof of hold to the <a>payee</a>
before finalizing payment and delivery of the product.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>. The <a>payee</a> receives
proof that the transfer of funds has been authorized.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>. The <a>payment scheme</a>
determines the details of payment clearing and settlement. Transfer times
may vary from near-realtime to multiple days. The <a>payee</a>,
the <a>payer</a>, and/or third parties (such as regulatory bodies) may be
notified as each stage of the clearing and settlement process is completed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Delivery of Product/Receipt and Refunds</h3>
      <p>
In the fourth phase of the payment process, the <a>transaction</a> is completed
by providing the <a>payer</a> with a receipt and/or the product that
was purchased.
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Delivery of Product</strong>. The <a>payer</a> receives goods or
services immediately, at a later date, automatically on a recurring basis,
etc. depending on the terms of the <a>purchase</a>. A digital proof of
payment may be required to access the product.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Receipt</strong>. Depending on the
<a title="payment scheme">payment scheme(s)</a> chosen, there are
various ways and times that a receipt may be delivered (e.g., credit card
receipt, digital proof of <a>purchase</a>, encrypted line-item receipt, etc.).
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Refunds</strong>. At times exceptions may occur (e.g., defective
product, application of store return policy, etc.). In this case, the
<a>payee</a> initiates payment to the <a>payer</a>. The refund may
take different forms, including a refund to the <a title="payer">payer's</a>
payment instrument, a refund using a different payment scheme, or store credit.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="phases-overview">A Simple Example of the Payment Phases</h2>
    <p>
The following scenario is provided to aid the reader in understanding how the
phases of the payment process apply to a real world situation. In this scenario,
we follow Jill, who seeks a new outfit for a party. She selects items from
PayToParty, which is a brick-and-mortar store with an online presence.
She chooses how to pay and the items are delivered to her home on the
following day.

    <p class="issue">
General feedback is requested on whether this section is helpful. We are
attempting to ground the payment phases and steps in a real world use case.
An alternative would be removing this section entirely if the preceding
section suffices, or moving this narrative to section 7 with the other examples.

      <h3>Negotiation of Purchase Terms</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>: Jill begins her <a>purchase</a> at
home on her laptop, where she browses the items on the PayToParty Web
site. On the way to work the next morning, she explores the catalog
further from a native app on her smart phone. Jill can't decide
whether the dress displayed online is blue with black stripes or white
with gold stripes, so during her lunch break, she drops into the
PayToParty store near her office. She spots a few more items that
she thinks she'd like to <a>purchase</a>, but decides to wait until later to
make the <a>purchase</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>: That same evening at home,
Jill logs into her account on the PayToParty Web site, adding her
preferred items to her shopping cart. The total price appears on the
page.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>: As Jill prepares to
check out, PayToParty notifies her of a discount for 10% if she uses
the store's loyalty card to pay.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Discovery of Accepted Schemes</strong>: Given where Jill lives,
PayToParty accepts payment by credit card, debit card, the PayToParty
loyalty card, and PayPal, but not Jill's favorite cryptocurrency (which she
uses on other sites).
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Selection of Payment Instruments</strong>: Jill pushes the
"Pay Now to Party!" button and is presented with a number of options
to pay, including her
credit card, her PayToParty loyalty card (which is highlighted to remind her
of the discount), and a PayPal account. There is also a gift card from
PayToParty that she received for her birthday, but she chooses not to
use it for this <a>purchase</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Authentication to Access Instruments</strong>: Jill selects
the PayToParty loyalty card, which she enabled with theft-protection,
and is asked to input a code that is sent to her phone before the
<a>purchase</a> can be completed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Processing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Initiation of Processing</strong>. PayToParty receives a
message from Jill's device authorizing the payment. PayToParty
submits the message to their <a>payment processor</a>, requesting a
proof of hold for the funds.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Verification of Available Funds</strong>. PayToParty
receives a proof of hold on Jill's funds for the <a>purchase</a> price of
the goods. The PayToParty night-shift employees begin packing her purchased
items for delivery the next day.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Authorization of Transfer</strong>. Once Jill's package is ready to
go, PayToParty exchanges the proof of hold for a proof of payment by
re-submitting the request to the payment network. They receive a proof of
payment from the <a>payment processor</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Completion of Transfer</strong>. Since Jill's PayToParty loyalty card
operates as a credit card, PayToParty will receive the funds in their normal
end of week settlement.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Delivery of Product/Receipt and Refunds</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Receipt</strong>. Jill's cloud-based wallet
receives a detailed line-item digital receipt for the <a>purchase</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
<strong>Delivery of Product</strong>. Jill's package goes out by courier the
next morning and is on her doorstep before she leaves for work.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Assumptions</h2>

    <p>
The use cases below rely on a number of assumptions that are not
detailed in the use cases but that will be explored in more detail in
the architecture and requirements documents.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Connectivity</strong>. Connectivity requirements vary according to
use case. The types of connections a device may use include Internet
connectivity, proxied connections through short-range radio transmissions,
and proximity connections over a technology such as Near-Field Communication
(NFC) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE). Some use cases assume no
connectivity (e.g., user is temporarily unable to connect to a mobile phone
network or a WiFi hotspot).
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Registered Payment Instruments</strong>. In order for the
<a>payer</a> to select and utilize
<a title="payment instrument">payment instruments</a>, they must be
registered in some way and discoverable by a browser, native application,
or other software.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Security</strong>. Keys, encryption, and other security technology
must be used to secure sensitive information. It is important that sensitive
information is not transmitted to parties that do not absolutely need to
know the information in order to complete the <a>transaction</a>.</li>
        <li>
<strong>Identity</strong>. There will be a consistent, interoperable
identifier used to identify the participants and accounts in a Web Payments
transaction.
        </li>
    </ul>

  <section>
    <h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>

    <p>
This section examines the phases of payment, and the steps involved in each
phase, through a variety of use cases. The purpose of this section is to
elaborate on the variety of scenarios present in each step of the payment
process.
    </p>

    <p class="issue">
General feedback is requested related to the general structure of the
use case snippets below. Are they focused enough to convey each topic listed?
Is there information that should be added to each use case in general? Would
more elaborate use cases be helpful? Would an attempt to minimize each existing
use further be helpful in scanning the document more quickly?

There are a large number of "paywall" websites on the Web that require a
customer to register before they may use the website. In many cases, if the
site isn't regularly visited by the customer, they abandon the transaction
when they see the paywall requirement. Providing a mechanism to sell an
inexpensive item to a customer without requiring registration would be of
great benefit to not only the merchants selling goods and services, but
customers that would like to avoid lengthy registration processes.

One of the biggest security flaws of <a>payee</a>-initiated payments is that
all the information necessary to initiate a <a>transaction</a> from the
<a title="payer">payer's</a> financial account is typically transmitted
to the <a>payee</a>. For example, credit card information along with
expiration date, name, and CVV2 code are transmitted and could be intercepted
by rogue software running on the <a title="payer">payer's</a> servers.
Special attention should be paid to ensuring that this risky security
model isn't supported by a Web Payments solution. For example, at a minimum,
credit card tokenization such as EMVCo's solution should be supported
alongside other tokenization solutions.

      <h3>Cryptocurrency Payment (Bitcoin, Ripple)</h3>
      <p>
The following scenario outlines an ideal payment experience using Bitcoin, or a
Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency. In this scenario, Lenne is buying a pair of
alpaca socks from an online retailer using a "buy one, get one free" coupon.
The socks are shipped to her home address.
      </p>

      <section class="notoc">
        <h4>Negotiation of Purchase Terms</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
<strong>Discovery of Offer</strong>: Lenne searches for "warm socks,
locally sourced" in her favorite search engine. A pair of Alpaca socks come up
as the first hit as the Alpaca's are nearby where she lives and the online
store (AlpacaToesCo) provides local delivery. She has a coupon in her
digital wallet for the store, but forgot long ago that it is there.
          </li>

          <li>
<strong>Agreement on Terms</strong>: Lenne goes to AlpacaToesCo and puts the
socks in her online shopping cart and is shown the price. Lenne provides her
shipping address to AlpacaToes.
          </li>

          <li>
<strong>Application of Marketing Elements</strong>: When Lenne puts the socks
in her online shopping cart, she's reminded of the "buy one, get one free"
coupon she has in her wallet. She adds another pair of socks and continues
with the checkout process.

device to approve the <a>purchase</a>.
