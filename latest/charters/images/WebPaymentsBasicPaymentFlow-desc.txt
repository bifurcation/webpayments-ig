This is a long description of this image:
https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-ig/blob/master/latest/charters/images/WebPaymentsBasicPaymentFlow.png

The purpose of the graphic is to illustrate (in a general sense)
the sort of payment flow that the standards deliverables of this
group intend to address.

The graphic identifies a number of entities that play a role
in the payment flow:

 - Payee payment processor
 - Web application
 - User agent
 - Wallet service
 - User

1. Payment begins with a Payment Initiation Request in the context of
a Web application (running in a user agent). The Web application sends
a "payment initiation request."

2. Branching question: Is there a wallet service configured ot handle
payment requests? If no, then the application redirects the payer
to a traditional payments page or some other payment flow.

3) Otherwise, if there is a wallet service, then "payment instrument
discovery" takes place and the following branching question is asked:
Does the payer have a payment instrument that can be used for this
payment? If no, then the application redirects the payer
to a traditional payments page or some other payment flow.

4) Otherwise, the user is prompted to select a payment instrument, to
confirm the terms of the transaction, and possibly to provide
additional data.

5) The wallet service then sends a "payment initiation response" to
the Web application.

6) The application validates the response and there is a branch at
this point between credit pull and debit push transactions. If the
selected payment instrument is "payee initiated" then payment
processing begins. If not, the Web application sends a "payment
completion request" to the wallet service.

7) If the selected payment instrument is "payer initiated" then
payment processing begins. After display of confirmation of payment,
the wallet service sends a payment completion request to the Web
Application.
