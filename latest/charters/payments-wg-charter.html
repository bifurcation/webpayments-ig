    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

    <p>Under this initial charter, the Working Group defines standards that ease integration of the payments ecosystem into the Web for a payment initiated from a Web site or Web application. Where practical the standards will be usable by native applications/apps.
</p><p>We anticipate the following benefits of this work:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Streamlined payment flow, which is expected to reduce the the percentage of transactions abandoned prior to completion ("shopping card abandonment").
</li>
<li> Increased customer satisfaction due to additional payment options available to users.
</li>
<li> Improved security and privacy by providing information only to those parties that require it to complete a transaction.
</li>
<li> Easier integration of new payment schemes by payment service providers, increasing merchant acceptance.
</li>
<li> Increased scope for digital wallet innovation by banks, retailers, mobile operators, card networks, and other wallet providers
</li>
<li> Added value through machine-readable digital payment requests and payment responses
</li>
</ul>
<p>The W3C is also planning other Working Groups to develop standards that will facilitate payments on the Web, on topics such as security.
</p><p><b>Note</b>: The Web Payments Interest Group expects to provide more detailed technical input to relevant W3C Working Groups including this one, based on a detailed analysis of the relevant <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/#an-overview-of-the-payment-phases">Web Payments Use Cases</a>.
</p>

    <div class="scope">
      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

<p>A payment, on the Web today, ordinarily starts on a payment page where the <b>payer</b> must manually select a payment scheme, manually select their own <b>payment instrument</b> for that <b>payment scheme,</b> manually capture the details of that instrument into the page (along with any other essential data such as a shipping address) and then submit this data back to the <b>payee.</b> The payment data briefly passes through the Web context (from the payer's user agent to the payee's Website) on it's way to a payment processor. At that point much of the communication to complete a payment takes place among banks, card networks, and other parties in the payment ecosystem typically outside of the "Web context."
</p><p>In an effort to improve upon this process, various parties have innovated ways to make the payment flow easier, for example by caching payment instrument information in browsers, registering users on eCommerce websites to facilitate re-use of customer data and/or payment credentials, and even developing new payment schemes. Unfortunately these efforts all suffer from a lack of standardization of the high level flow of a Web payment, of the interfaces between the various parties, the user agent and the Web application, or of the messages exchanged between these parties over the Web.
</p><p>This group will create open Web standards for the interfaces in and out of the Web context to provide interoperability between payment systems (existing and future), and encourage greater automation of steps in a typical payment. The interfaces between the payment schemes and the Web are via the user agent and the Web application, therefore the scope of the initial charter is focused on the interactions between these two components and the external actors that will interface directly with them.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> W3C expects to a wider variety of of eCommerce scenarios over time, including digital receipts; loyalty programs and coupons; peer-to-peer payments; and harmonization of user experience in-browser, in-app, and in-store. For more information, see the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Payments Use Cases</a> published by the W3C Web Payments Interest Group.
</p>
<h3 id="wallets">Wallets</h3>
<p>The standards from this group may be implemented in a variety of ways, including as stand-alone applications, in the cloud, or within user agents such as browsers. Some of the functionality provided by the standards from this group can be found in various Web services today, as well as in digital wallets. Because the "digital wallet" concept can be useful as a shorthand, but means different things to different audiences, this charter includes a definition to clarify the intent of this group. In this charter we define a <b>wallet</b> as a software service, providing similar functions in the digital world to those provided by a physical wallet, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li> It holds payment instruments registered by the wallet owner;
</li>
<li> It supports certain payment schemes and enables the payer to use registered payment instruments to execute a payment in accordance with that scheme;
</li>
<li> It may hold one or more balances of some digital asset that can be used to make payments.
</li>
</ul>
<p>This definition of wallet may expand in the future to include other items people find in physical wallets such as digital receipts, coupons, and identification.
</p><p>The group intends to create a standard interface from the Web to a user's wallet so that a user with any conforming wallet can seamlessly make payments with any conforming Web application running in a conforming user agent. Though not a requirement for this charter, the group may define APIs that may also be used outside of a browser context (such as from within a native application, where the browser is not the proxy between wallet and payee application).
</p><p>The group will also consider the use case where a wallet serves as an aggregator of other wallets, which should increase user choice of payment solutions.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> The Working Group anticipates a rich ecosystem of eCommerce and payment functionality, including loyalty schemes and coupons, digital receipts, location services, marketing additions, and so on. Some of these functionalities may be provided by a digital wallet, or by other aggregating services available to the user. This charter does not seek to preclude those additional services, and in the future W3C may look for standardization opportunities to increase interoperability of such services.
</p>
<h3 id="payment_flow">Payment Flow</h3>
<p>The scope of work supports the following elements of a basic purchase triggered by user interaction with a Web application initiating a new payment. These standards define a high-level message flow to facilitate a payment from payer to payee either in the form of a credit push (payer initiated) or a debit pull (payee initiated) that can be used to facilitate a payment from any payment scheme.
</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Pre-Payment</dt>
  <dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Registration</b>, by the payer with their wallet, of any conforming <b>payment instrument</b> they wish to use on the Web (e.g. a credit card, electronic cash, cryptocurrency, etc).
</li>
</ul>
  </dd>
 <dt>Negotiation of Terms</dt>
<dd>
<ul>
<li> <b>Payment Request</b>, by the payee to the payer providing the terms of the payment including elements such as the accepted payment schemes, price, currency, recurrence, transaction type (purchase, refund etc.) and requests for any additional data that is required from the payee.
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
  <dt>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</dt>
  <dd>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Discovery</b>, by the payer, of their available payment instruments that can be used to make the payment. This is done by matching those registered by the payer with those supported by the payee (as defined in the Payment Request), while keeping information local to the payer.
</li>
<li> <b>Selection of a payment instrument</b> by the payer, confirmation of the terms and sending of any requested data back to the payee for validation.
</li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>Payment Processing</dt>
  <dd>
<ul>
<li> Execution of the payment by either payer or payee.
</li>
<li> Delivery of a <b>Payment Completion</b> generated by the entity that executed the payment. This may contain a <b>Proof of Payment</b> if supported by the payment scheme.
</li>
</ul>
  </dd>
  </dl>
<p>The group will also address exceptions that may occur during these steps, including payment authorization failure.
</p>
<h3 id="security">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>
<p>Security is obviously critical in payments and while the initial work of the group will leave much of the required security and authentication to the payment schemes it is important to ensure that any additions to the Web platform are secure and tamper-proof. The ability to manipulate any message in a payment flow has potentially massive financial impact therefore message integrity and verification of all message originators should be a key consideration for any work done by the group.
</p><p>Protection of the privacy of all participants in a payment is essential to maintaining the trust that payment systems are dependent upon to function. Any payment process defined by the group should not disclose private details of the participants identity or other sensitive information without their explicit consent and the design of any public facing API should ensure it is not possible for such data to be leaked through exploitation of the API.
</p>
<h3 id="out_of_scope">Out of Scope</h3>
<p>This group will not define a new payment scheme, or redefine that which is already addressed today by payment schemes. The standards from this group will provide a channel for protocols and messages defined by payment schemes, or that can be used across payment schemes.

      <h3 id="rec_track">Recommendation-track deliverables</h3>
<h4 id="Web_Payment_Vocabularies_1.0">Web Payment Vocabularies 1.0</h4>
<p>The Working Group will develop machine-readable vocabularies that enable the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Payment Scheme Description</b>: this vocabulary is used by payees to represent accepted schemes, and by payers to represent their available payment schemes and instruments.
</li>
<li><b>Payment Term Description</b>: used to define the terms requested by the payee prior to payment initiation. It includes information such as amount, currency, payee account information, recurrence, transaction reference and any scheme specific data that is required.
</li>
<li><b>Proof of Payment</b>: a verifiable payment authorization from the account provider to the payee. The proof must include information about the payment request (a transaction reference or similar) and the payer's payment instrument.
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Web_Transactions_1.0">Web Transactions 1.0</h4>
<p>The Working Group will define <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/">WebIDL</a> APIs that enable the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Web Payment Initiation</b>: The browser or other user agent passes a payment request to a payer wallet and returns the details of the payment initiation response from the wallet. The wallet should present a set of payment instruments to the payer for selection and gather the required data to pass back to the payee with user mediation where necessary.
</li>
<li> <b>Web Payment Completion</b>: The browser passes a payment completion request to a payer wallet and returns the details of the payment completion response from the wallet. If this was a payer-initiated payment, this is the trigger to execute the payment otherwise this is a message advising of the result of a payee initiated payment.
</li>
</ul>

      <p>To be successful, the Web Payments Architecture Working Group is expected to have  active participants for its
      duration. Effective participation to Web Payments Architecture Working Group may consume
       for each
      participant;  for
      editors. The Web Payments Architecture Working Group will
      allocate also the necessary resources for building Test
      Suites for each specification.</p>

	<p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public
	mailing list public-paymentsarch-wg@w3.org (archive).
        Administrative tasks may be conducted in
	Member-only communications.
	</p>

      <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants,
      face-to-face
      meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is

    </div>

    <div class="decisions">
      <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

      <p>As explained in the Process Document
      (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section
      3.3</a>), this group will seek to make decisions when there is
      consensus. When the Chair puts a question and observes dissent,
      after due consideration of different opinions, the Chairs should
      put a question out for voting within the group (allowing for
      remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email
      and/or web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along
      with any objections. The matter should then be considered
      resolved unless and until new information becomes available.

      <p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or
      teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day call for
      consensus on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional
      until 5 working days after the publication of the resolution in
      draft minutes, available from the WG's calendar or home page. If
      no objections are raised on the mailing list within that time,
      the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a
      resolution of the Working Group.</p>
