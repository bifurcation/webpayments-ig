    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
The purpose of this document is to outline a coherent implementation and
deployment strategy for the Web Payments standardization work at W3C.
This document is separated into sections that describe "versions" that
consist of the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
Strategic goals for the version.
      </li>
      <li>
Basic capabilities that are targeted and which groups are responsible for
delivering the capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
Organization of standardization of those capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
Deployment goals and strategies
      </li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Version 1</h2>

    <p>
The initial implementation of the Web Payments work will focus on delivering
standards for a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) by December 2017.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
Lower cost of integration of payment services via standard wallet
(payment agent) APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
Lower cost of satisfying Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements when
performing payments.
        </li>
        <li>
Increased usability, privacy, and security for users.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
      <p>
The following table shows the capabilities for this version, with annotations
about where those capabilities arise in the payment flow and which groups will
work on them. As we progress, we will include links to definitions of these
capabilities, descriptions of phases in the use cases document, and
draft charters.

      <h3>Deployment and Adoption</h3>
      <p>
Deployment in version 1 will focus on enabling a few major online retailers
to run Web Payment agents to issue Web Payment invoices for processing at
1-2 major online Payment Service Providers (or banks). The payment
institutions would then initiate the payment and send a proof of payment
back to the retailer.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
3 major online retailers launching Web Payments support (for example:
Alibaba, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Overstock.com, Amazon, Tesco, eBay, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
1-2 large online payment companies (or banks) launching Web Payments support
(for example: Google Wallet, PayPal, Alipay, Bank of America, HSBC,
US Fed, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
5-10 smaller players from the online retail space and the payments space
            </li>
            <li>
1 million payments within the first year after standardization
            </li>
            <li>
Favorable reviews by the Web developer community
            </li>
          </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Strategies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Deployment strategy should be a pure software deployment. Do not require new hardware to be deployed.
          </li>
          <li>
Specifications should focus on technology that has already been prototyped.
          </li>
          <li>
All software should be cloud-only for version 1. For example, do not try to
support both cloud and local wallets due to a possible conflict around the
"payment message bus" being implemented at the OS layer or the browser layer.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Unresolved Issues</h3>
      <p class="issue">
Where we need an extensible message format, we will want to specify at least
a data model. The hard question will be whether we can achieve a single
serialization (e.g., JSON or JSON-LD or XML) or whether we need multiple.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
What canonicalization (if any) is needed in our messages for the purpose of
digital signatures.
