    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
The purpose of this document is to outline a coherent implementation and 
deployment strategy for the Web Payments standardization work at W3C.
This document is separated into sections that describe "versions" that 
consist of the following:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
Strategic goals for the version.
      </li>
      <li>
Basic capabilities that are targeted and which groups are responsible for 
delivering the capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
Organization of standardization of those capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
Deployment goals and strategies
      </li>
    </ul>
    
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Version 1</h2>

    <p>
The initial implementation of the Web Payments work will focus on delivering 
standards for a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP) by December 2017.
    </p>
    
    <section>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
Lower cost of integration of payment services via standard wallet 
(payment agent) APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
Lower cost of satisfying Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements when 
performing payments.
        </li>
        <li>
Increased usability, privacy, and security for users.        
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
      <p>
The following table shows the capabilities for this version, with annotations 
about where those capabilities arise in the payment flow and which groups will 
work on them. As we progress, we will include links to definitions of these 
capabilities, descriptions of phases in the use cases document, and 
draft charters.
