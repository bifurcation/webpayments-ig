    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
The purpose of this document is to outline a coherent implementation and
deployment strategy for the Web Payments standardization work at W3C.
This document is separated into sections that describe "versions" that
consist of the following:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
Strategic goals for the version.
      </li>
      <li>
Basic capabilities that are targeted and which groups are responsible for
delivering the capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
Organization of standardization of those capabilities.
      </li>
      <li>
Deployment goals and strategies
      </li>
    </ul>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Version 1</h2>

    <p>
The initial implementation of the Web Payments work will start in October 2015
and will focus on delivering standards for a Minimum Viable Platform (MVP)
by December 2017.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
<strong>Payment ecosystem integration</strong>: Interoperable support for a
simple payment scenario. This includes the steps of 1) invoking a payment
request, 2) selecting a payment instrument, 3) initiating funds transfer,
and 4) delivering a proof of payment.
        </li>
        <li>
<strong>Security</strong>: Digital signatures, encryption, and
multi-factor authentication.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Use Cases</h3>

      <h3>Deployment and Adoption</h3>
      <p>
Deployment in version 1 will focus on enabling a few major online retailers
to run Web Payment agents to issue Web Payment invoices for processing at
1-2 major online Payment Service Providers (or banks). The payment
institutions would then initiate the payment and send a proof of payment
back to the retailer.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
3 major online retailers launching Web Payments support (for example:
Alibaba, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Overstock.com, Amazon, Tesco, eBay, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
1-2 large online payment companies (or banks) launching Web Payments support
(for example: Google Wallet, PayPal, Alipay, Bank of America, HSBC,
US Fed, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>
5-10 smaller players from the online retail space and the payments space
            </li>
            <li>
1 million payments within the first year after standardization
            </li>
            <li>
Favorable reviews by the Web developer community
            </li>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Strategies</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
Deployment strategy should be a pure software deployment. Do not require new hardware to be deployed.
          </li>
          <li>
Specifications should focus on technology that has already been prototyped.
          </li>
          <li>
All software should be cloud-only for version 1. For example, do not try to
support both cloud and local wallets due to a possible conflict around the
"payment message bus" being implemented at the OS layer or the browser layer.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Unresolved Issues</h3>
      <p class="issue">
Where we need an extensible message format, we will want to specify at least
a data model. The hard question will be whether we can achieve a single
serialization (e.g., JSON or JSON-LD or XML) or whether we need multiple.
      </p>
      <p class="issue">
What canonicalization (if any) is needed in our messages for the purpose of
digital signatures.
