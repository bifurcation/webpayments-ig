This document describes a conceptual unified architecture and set of communication/protocol standards for payments on the World Wide Web. The architecture and examples included in this document outline a set of core principles and abstractions required to achieve broad interoperability across the many and growing number of users and devices connected to the Web, as well as the core goals such as security, privacy, and user choice outlined in the W3C's Web Payments Charter. The document also includes practical examples of how the architecture could be used to achieve these goals which are based on the Web Payments IG Use Cases document.

    <h3>The Challenge with Payments on the Web</h3> 
    This section will provide introductory context and outline key problems that the Payment Agent Architecture is trying to address
  </section>

  <section> 
    <h3>Key Principles and Goals</h3> 
    <p>This Section will provide an introduction to Key principles, abstractions and rationale behind the subsequent proposal.  This section should also clearly outline what the architecture is NOT intended to do. (ex. replace existing payments standards such as ISO20022 or IS12812.</p>
    <p>
		Key Principles/Goals that this Conceptual Architecture is intended to address:
		<ol type='1'>
			<li>Provide a standard inteface for the collection and exchange of payment related information from user agents (ex. browsers, apps, or other web-enabled clients) which meets the following criteria:
			<ol type='a'>
				<li>Supports consistent, secure interface and apis for communication of payment data required to support payment schemes (ex. cards, digital currency, etc.) for common data elements</li>
				<li>Provides ability to access information needed as part of the payment process in a standard way (ex, authentication data, account information, loyalty cards, etc.)</li>
				<li>Is consistent across multiple deployment contaniners found on the web (ex. Mobile, Laptop, etc)/li>
				<li>Supports access from either local or remote user agents</li>
				<li>Supports communication with existing and future payment schemes/infrastructure to facilitate value tranfer</li>
				<li>Coordinates with other payment agents to facilitate payments related information flows</li>
				<li>Supports accessbility of payments on the web by incorporating all accessibility standards and promoting interoperabiltiy with user agents which support users with diabilities.

   This section outlines a higher level, easy to understand description of elements needed to support payments on the web in a manner which acheives above listed goals.  This section may also list known  available or in process standards that can help to leverage corresponding standards that have already been created.

    <h3>Deployment Contexts</h3> 
    This section of the document provides an introduction to the types of infrastructure (ex. mobile device, Server, etc) that would likely host components of the architecture.  This is important as specific deployment contexts may create constraints that impact how elements of the architecture can be implemented.  This section will also highlight specfic standards that may apply to a speicific portion of the overll architecture.

      <h3>Putting things together</h3> 
      <p>
		  This section of the document will outline a more detailed view of how the payment architecture concepts might be deployed in context as part of a multi-user agent payment processing flow.  For example, this section could include an overview of how specific user agents of the Payer such as a digital Wallet interact with specific user agents of the Payee such as a digital POS terminal and user agents of payment processors such as payment processing schemes to facilitate payment.

	    <h2>Required (core) Capabilities</h2> 
	    <p>
	This section outlines the required capabilities that all User Agents involved with the payments process and associated communication protocols must provide to meet minimal viable requirements:
	<ul>
	<li>Ability to receive and reply with standard formatted messages following payment agent API/protocol specifications</li>
	<li>Abiltiy to interact with user agent Display Services for displaying payment related information</li>
	<li>Ability support synchornization between multiple payment agents operating on behalf of a single user agent</li>
	<li>Ability to support user agents running locally and remotely from payment agent</li>
	
	(NEED TO TIE TO CORE STANDARDS)

	  	<h2>Introduction to the Payment Agent API - A look at Payment Agent Communciation and Messaging</h2>
		<p>
			The Payment Agent API is a standard protocol and set of API's which facilitate exchange of payment related data in a standard manner with user agents.  The following is a list of the API's that the Payment Agent protocol will support:
			<ul>
				<li>Identification and Authentication of Payment Participants</li>
				<li>Payment Scheme/Instrument selection, clearing and settlement</li>
				<li>Contracts and conditional payment</li>
				<li>Authorization, Monitoring and Control</li>
				<li>Ledger and Accounting</li>
				<li>Taxation</li>
				<li>Delivery and Shipping</li>
				<li>Payment Scheduling and Calendering</li>
