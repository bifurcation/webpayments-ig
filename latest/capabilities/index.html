Payments and the ability to exchange value efficiently and securely over the
web are critical to global commerce. Open standards for payments and value
exchange help ensure open access and interoperability to financial systems for
all the people that use the Web. This document describes aset of capabilities
that, if standardized, will improve payments on the Web.

    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="overview">
    <h1>Overview of Capabilities</h1>

    <p>Capabilities are functionalities necessary to implement payments on the
    Web. We include capabilities specific to payments but also capabilities that
    support payments (such as security) and capabilities more broadly related to
    commerce, as it is important to understand the full context in which payments
    occur.</p>

    <p>We organize capabilities into five groups.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Security Core</strong> - These capabilities provide the security
        foundation for payments.
        <div style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>Capabilities</strong>: Key Creation and
        Management, Cryptographic Signatures, Encryption</div>
        <div class="issue">Right now this group has
        only security capabilities in it. We may wish to have a more general
        purpose Core set. If so, what would this core set include?</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Trust and Identity - </strong>Includes features related to establishing
        trust among parties, and credentialing or authorization of parties involved
        in a transaction.
        <div style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>Capabilities</strong>:
        Identity, Credentials, Rights, Authentication, Authorization, Privacy, Discovery,
        Registration, Enrollment, and Legal/Regulatory concerns.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Accounts and Settlement - </strong>Includes capabilities related to
        managing stores of value (such as Deposit Accounts) and recorded accounts
        of ownership (such as Ledger entries, Deeds, etc.) used as part of the
        settlement of payments or commercial exchanges. Settlement via the Web
        involves access to the accounts of the participants and ledgers of the
        account providers and capabilities to manage accounts and capture and
        monitor transactions in a ledger against those accounts.<br />
        <div style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>Capabilities</strong>:
        Accounts, Ledgers, and Legal/Regulatory
        concerns related to accounting and recorded ownership.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Payments and Clearing - </strong>These are the capabilities that help
        parties in a transaction establish the mechanics of how the payment will be
        executed and the directly or indirectly make this happen. This involves the
        ability to discover and negotiate the mechanism that will be used to
        execute the payment and agree on the terms including facts such as the
        costs of making the payment, time between clearing of the payment and
        settlement into the payee’s account, regulatory requirements and required
        authorisations.
        <div style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>Capabilities</strong>:
        Funding, Payment, Messaging, Clearing, Markets, Foreign/Currency
        Exchange, and Legal/regulatory concerns specific to Payments and
        Exchange of Value.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Commerce - </strong>Includes capabilities related to commercial and
        economic interactions.
        <div style="margin-left:2em;"><strong>Capabilities</strong>:
        Offers, Invoicing, Receipts, Loyalty, Rewards,
        Contracts, Lending, Insurance, Taxation, Legal/Regulatory concerns related
        to aspects of commercial and economic interactions.</div>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>The Interest Group anticipates that these groups will make it easier to
    define modules that may be reused at a variety of times in a payment
    transaction, to prioritize capabilities and craft charters for groups to
    standardize them, and to communicate the group’s plans with other standards
    bodies and organizations.</p>

    <p class="note">Some of these capabilities are expected be useful outside of payment
    scenarios.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Capabilities in Context</h2>

    <section>
      <h3>Digital Wallets and Payment Agents</h3>

      <p>Although the capabilities described in this document may be used and
      composed in a variety of ways to fulfill payments use cases, the Interest Group
      anticipates that in many cases, they will be packaged in “payment agents” (or
      “digital wallets”) that act as a bridge between the merchant, the user, and the
      user’s account providers.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Service Providers</h3>

      <p>The roles illustrated here may be carried out by many different entities.
      For example, "account provider" may be carried out by financial institutions,
      mobile operators, tech companies, or cryptocurrency systems; “payee” may be an
      individual, a business, an NGO, or any entity that can accept a payment.</p>

      <p>A payment may involve just two parties (e.g., peer-to-peer) or may be
      carried out by several collaborating parties. For instance, a payee may use a
      payment service provider which in turn uses a card network. The actions of
      these intermediaries may vary, from simply forwarding messages to fulfilling
      regulatory obligations. Additionally, these interactions may happen in
      different sequences and direction depending on the payment context.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Payment Interactions</h3>

    <p>To simplify and harmonize the descriptions of capabilities necessary for
    payments and value exchange on the Web, it is helpful to understand the parties
    involved and the direction that information flows among them at various
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/#an-overview-of-the-payment-phases">
    phases</a> of a payment. We use the following diagram to help illustrate
    roles and information flow:</p>

    <p>@@@ Figure: Payment Interaction Wheel @@@</p>

    <p>For example, the following diagrams illustrate three interactions in a
    comment payment scenario.</p>

    <p><span><img alt="Request for Payment.png" src="images/image03.png" title=
    "" /></span></p>

    <p>Interaction 1:</p>

    <p>Payee communicates request for payment to payer and shares payment
    instructions</p>

    <p><span><img alt="Payer-PayeeService Provider.png" src="images/image02.png"
    title="" /></span></p>

    <p>Interaction 2:</p>

    <p>Payer uses information received from Payee and creates a new payment
    request from Payment Service Provider with stored value.</p>

    <p><span><img alt="PSPtoPSP.png" src="images/image04.png" title=
    "" /></span></p>

    <p>Interaction 3:</p>

    <p>Payer’s Payment Service Provider sends details to complete payment to
    Payee’s</p>

      <h3>Security Core</h3>

      <p class="issue">Describe any key concepts/relationship to other capabilities here...</p>

      <section>
        <h4>Key Management</h4>

        <p>All participants require an interchangeable mechanism for creation,
        management, storage and exchange of cryptographic keys</p>

        <p>Key management capabilities are required to:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Securely communicate unique identifiers of payment process
          participants</li>

          <li>Digitally sign and authenticate information exchanged as part of the
          payments process (ex. payments, receipts, invoices, etc.)</li>

          <li>Provide reference key for independent elements of the payments process to
          compose/link transactions and related data across asynchronous segments of
          the payment process</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Cryptographic Signatures</h4>

        <p>Information transferred should be cryptographically signed to ensure</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Authenticity of the participants and ownership of value/asset being
          transferred or exchanged</li>

          <li>Nonrepudiation of participants intent related to information /
          communication being exchanged</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h4>Suggested Deliverables</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Data model with a concrete syntax for expressing data in the
          architecture</li>

          <li>Web-based key public key infrastructure data formats and protocols</li>

          <li>New normalization mechanisms for data model serialization (if necessary,
          for digital signatures)</li>
